const ES7 = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>ES7</h2>
      <p>
        Here we have some of the features that ES7 added that are nice to use in
        react <br />
        <br />
        - rafce = When called in jsx file it CREATES AN ARROWfunction component
        already default exported for you <br />
        <br />
        - rfce = When called in jsx file it CREATES A REGULAR function component
        already default exported for you

        <br /><br />

        Both of them will be made with the name of the component out of the bat so you don t have to

        <br /> <br />

        - Another thing is that when you write certain things like useState for example it will import it from react automatically for you
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
export default ES7
